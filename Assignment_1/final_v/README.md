**Design metaphors** - What metaphors are used that people can relate to. Are they good or bad?

- A people icon with a plus sign is used to represent adding new friends. This metaphor is good, it precisely describes what this icon is used for -- adding people to our friend list.
- An picture with more people icon is used to represent group chat. With more people icon in the picture, we can easily tell this means group, and without plus sign, it can only be the entry to group chat, thus this metaphor is also great.
- And a compass is used to represent "findings", where new posts sent by friends, QR code scanner, games are located here. Using compass to represent "findings" is a good idea, however, features arregated here are not all connected with "findings". 

**Design critique** - Do you think this software is well designed? Pick 2 attributes (color palette, shape, etc.) to critique about the design.

- Yes. The color palette is well organized as the foundational colors is defined as gray and white, and not too many tints and shades makes the design looks clear. When a specific icon is tapped, it becomes from gray to its brand color -- green. And when a chat is choosed, the color becomes from white to gray. By doing this, weChat helps user memorize those interactive colors. The only flaw about the color palette is that weChat use icons consist of too many colors in the "findings" section. However, the shapes have corners which are anchored to screen edges, this makes the chat boxes look not emphasized enough.

**Design improvements** - What would you do to improve this product? (Base this discussion on each of the two design critiques)

- I would change the shape of chat boxes to round corner and reduce the colors used in the icons in the "findings" section.

**Future testing** - How would you test your two design improvements?

- I would use usability testing: 
1) presenting wireframes of new design to users and watch their reactions.
2) collecting information such as effectiveness of weChat and user satisfaction to eliminate usability problems.
3) presenting users the new version and the old version and asking for users opinion.
